  <h1>Background every web developer needs to know</h1>
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> I have alwalys had this fear, can i do this? You'll never know till you try..lol.. GRACE. So I'm supposed to type a whole lot of crap, well... lets go shopping...<br><br>I am applying to study applied math at the University of Edinburgh. Having researched their staff profile, the course modules and the level of international student’s mix, I believe strongly that a degree in math from the school will be a life-changing experience. Specifically, I have a future career interest of being a proactive part of a team that uses ICT to proffer solutions to African development issues. To build such capacity, the knowledge of Linear Algebra, Multivariate calculus, Probability theory, statistics, Algorithms, Complex optimization, Real and Complex Analysis which are in the course contests would be handy in venturing into the world of machine learning and data science. The opportunity to learn from experts in this field, and as well share knowledge with students from other countries will be second to none. Thus I believe that at the end of this program, I would be groomed to fit well into a dynamic and transformational ICT firms/hubs that build models and products that one can utilize in an African context to solve development and business problems.

<h3>Don't mind the unprofessional change of subject, i just want to fill in this web page</h3>
<p>While I can work independently to give a competitive result, I prefer working with an effective team. Thus, I often work to create teams or friends who I can engage with in group learning and discussion. This enables me access topics from different point of view, and enables a more rapid and effective learning.
During my perspective program <br> &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt <br> at the University of Edinburgh, I as well value and appreciate the impacts of senior colleagues in development of the younger ones. Hence I as well create and maintain mentor-mentee relationships in schools, internship places, and other professional settings I have been to. I would want to have mentors who will direct and encourage me in my academic studies.
I would join volunteer groups where I will learn to serve and interact with people not in my cause of study.<br><br> I would join academic clubs, platforms where I can meet different people from different walks and diverse experiences, who together, we can improve each other’s knowledge. This will help me develop my leadership skills, and improve my social lifestyles, thus, improving my knowledge and usage of ICT skills. 
The experiences gathered from this relations, will provide a wide range of career skills set. This will help me contribute effectively to the development of my country. In sum, I will acquire social and technical skills from my associations in school that will help me to solve real life problems back home.
