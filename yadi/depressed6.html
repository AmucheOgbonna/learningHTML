    <p>Technically, I was too bored this morning to start up anything. But, I thought, hey! What if I consturct a simple HTML and CSS documents, right? So what can be more intriguing than giving you a little of my life stories.<br>
    Nevertheless, I wouldn't like to bore you, this is a little of my write-up, that i will like to make into something worthwhile. I really hope you enjoy it. Thank you.<br>
    Man always seeks consolation, always. They are always questions, that have no answers, no answers. They may seem to have answers today, but none tomorrow.
Everybody needs to be heard, wants to be seen, even if they don’t want to admit it. We all want love, acceptance, recognition, any how we may put it.
What hurts me most, is how Christ is been blamed for it all. How man have configured the scriptures for themselves. Sometimes I don’t understand people, this issue of relationship, marriage and friendship. You think it’s easy, I just hate the process sometimes. You try reaching out to people, but they always feel almighty. We always like to assume we are the best, we are though. This sometimes comes from excessive ego and self-fulfillment. I don’t understand a life without Christ. I just don’t understand. No matter how much you seek advice or consolation from people, it will never be enough. It just lasts for a little while, because those people don’t really feel your pain. If they do, they don’t even know how to express them or relate to you.
Another issue, is the issue of betrayal. It still hurts after two years, two whole years. I must say, I feel ashamed of myself. I cannot even forgive.<br> Forgiveness is not acquired when one cannot forgive. Everything is connected, because in agreeing and attesting to the knowledge of one, leads to the reprobation of another knowledge. 
They say religion has caused harm, I look into the different religions, especially the Christian denominations. I see the key rules, LOVE. But this is the least rule for humans. Even though I should love as Christ loved, it hurts me most especially, when I see people that speak against Christ. I just pray God gives us his eyes. I have lots of 
questions; they keep arising every day. It was clear to me recently, that a life according to the direct pattern of Christ, you are really a fool on earth.<br> A fool for Christ. If only we are fools in all ramifications, if only we could understand better. To many IF ONLY’S. it is well, at the end we will know what really mattered, but God let the end not be in the other rear.
These questions increase every day, actually right now I am in the process of finding Christ, or more correctly letting Christ find me, by being just where he can find me. God has been very good to me I must say. After my graduation from senior secondary school, I have had a lot of doubts about religion, too many questions that I don’t have answers to. I have been able to reconcile some of my doubts and if let me with one realization “it takes more than the scriptures to believe in God, it takes grace, it takes personal encounter”. Even though you read so many stories; nit that they wouldn’t help though, just that you have to really experience it. All these brings me to the conclusion that God is mighty and mysterious. It also taught me that Christianity is blind followership. It also taught me that being a full pledged follower of Christ is to be an enemy to all especially, oneself.
And I have another question, who I can’t say when it will be answer, Who can bring about a change in Someone, whose right id that?
We now live in a generation of rights and privileges, of totally freedom I would say, according to the definition of freedom. Every day I keep on making a prayer to God, my prayer today is… God please find me, and if I hesitate bundle me.
